# algorithmia Code

Small exercises to practise some algorithmia. The majority of the exercises are from LeetCode [https://leetcode.com/](https://)

## How to use

Each program is solved in Python and Java. You have to insert the number of the problem and the result of one example is shown.

### 66.PLUS ONE

You are given a **large integer** represented as an integer array `digits`, where each `digits[i]` is the `i<sup>th</sup>` digit of the integer. The digits are ordered from most significant to least significant in left-to-right order. The large integer does not contain any leading `0`'s.

Increment the large integer by one and return *the resulting array of digits*.

**Example 1:**

<pre><strong>Input:</strong> digits = [1,2,3]
<strong>Output:</strong> [1,2,4]
<strong>Explanation:</strong> The array represents the integer 123.
Incrementing by one gives 123 + 1 = 124.
Thus, the result should be [1,2,4].
</pre>

**Example 2:**

<pre><strong>Input:</strong> digits = [4,3,2,1]
<strong>Output:</strong> [4,3,2,2]
<strong>Explanation:</strong> The array represents the integer 4321.
Incrementing by one gives 4321 + 1 = 4322.
Thus, the result should be [4,3,2,2].</pre>
