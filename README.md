# algorithmia Code

Small exercises to practise some algorithmia. The majority of the exercises are from LeetCode [https://leetcode.com/](https://)

## How to use

Each program is solved in Python and Java. You have to insert the number of the problem and the result of one example is shown.

### 55. Jump Game

You are given an integer array `nums`. You are initially positioned at the array's **first index**, and each element in the array represents your maximum jump length at that position.

Return `true` *if you can reach the last index, or* `false`* otherwise*.

**Example 1:**

<pre><strong>Input:</strong> nums = [2,3,1,1,4]
<strong>Output:</strong> true
<strong>Explanation:</strong> Jump 1 step from index 0 to 1, then 3 steps to the last index.
</pre>

**Example 2:**

<pre><strong>Input:</strong> nums = [3,2,1,0,4]
<strong>Output:</strong> false
<strong>Explanation:</strong> You will always arrive at index 3 no matter what. Its maximum jump length is 0, which makes it impossible to reach the last index.</pre>


### 66.PLUS ONE

You are given a **large integer** represented as an integer array `digits`, where each `digits[i]` is the `i<sup>th</sup>` digit of the integer. The digits are ordered from most significant to least significant in left-to-right order. The large integer does not contain any leading `0`'s.

Increment the large integer by one and return *the resulting array of digits*.

**Example 1:**

<pre><strong>Input:</strong> digits = [1,2,3]
<strong>Output:</strong> [1,2,4]
<strong>Explanation:</strong> The array represents the integer 123.
Incrementing by one gives 123 + 1 = 124.
Thus, the result should be [1,2,4].
</pre>

**Example 2:**

<pre><strong>Input:</strong> digits = [4,3,2,1]
<strong>Output:</strong> [4,3,2,2]
<strong>Explanation:</strong> The array represents the integer 4321.
Incrementing by one gives 4321 + 1 = 4322.
Thus, the result should be [4,3,2,2].</pre>

### 121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock

You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `i<sup>th</sup>` day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a **single day** to buy one stock and choosing a **different day in the future** to sell that stock.

Return *the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction*. If you cannot achieve any profit, return `0`.

**Example 1:**

<pre><strong>Input:</strong> prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
<strong>Output:</strong> 5
<strong>Explanation:</strong> Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.
</pre>

**Example 2:**

<pre><strong>Input:</strong> prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
<strong>Output:</strong> 0
<strong>Explanation:</strong> In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.</pre>

### 169. Majority Element

Given an array `nums` of size `n`, return *the majority element*.

The majority element is the element that appears more than `⌊n / 2⌋` times. You may assume that the majority element always exists in the array.

**Example 1:**

<pre><strong>Input:</strong> nums = [3,2,3]
<strong>Output:</strong> 3</pre>

### 189. Rotate Array

Given an integer array `nums`, rotate the array to the right by `k` steps, where `k` is non-negative.

**Example 1:**

<pre><strong>Input:</strong> nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], k = 3
<strong>Output:</strong> [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]
<strong>Explanation:</strong>
rotate 1 steps to the right: [7,1,2,3,4,5,6]
rotate 2 steps to the right: [6,7,1,2,3,4,5]
rotate 3 steps to the right: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]
</pre>

**Example 2:**

<pre><strong>Input:</strong> nums = [-1,-100,3,99], k = 2
<strong>Output:</strong> [3,99,-1,-100]
<strong>Explanation:</strong> 
rotate 1 steps to the right: [99,-1,-100,3]
rotate 2 steps to the right: [3,99,-1,-100]</pre>
